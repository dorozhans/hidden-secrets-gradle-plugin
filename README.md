# Gradle plugin to deeply hide secrets on Android

This plugin allows any Android developer to deeply hide secrets in its project. It is an OSS equivalent of what [DexGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/dexguard) can offer to prevent **credentials harvesting**.

It uses a combination of obfuscation techniques to do so :
- secret is obfuscated using the reversible XOR operator so it never appears in plain sight,
- obfuscated secret is stored in a NDK binary as an hexadecimal array, so it is really hard to spot / put together from a disassembly,
- the obfuscating string is not persisted in the binary to force runtime evaluation (ie : prevent the compiler from disclosing the secret by optimizing the de-obfuscation logic),
- optionally, anyone can provide its own encoding / decoding algorithm when using the plugin to add an additional security layer.

This plugin is **used in production** at [Klaxit - Covoiturage quotidien](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wayzup.wayzupapp). Our engineering team at Klaxit will provide its best effort to maintain this project.

‚ö†Ô∏è Nothing on the client-side is unbreakable. So generally speaking, **keeping a secret in a mobile package is not a smart idea**. But when you absolutely need to, this is the best method we have found to hide it.

## This is a kotlin gradle plugin
This project is also a demonstration on how to create a full Kotlin gradle plugin for Android projects.

## Compatibility
This gradle plugin can be used with any Android project in Java or Kotlin.

# 1 - Install the plugin

Get the latest version of the plugin from [releases](https://github.com/klaxit/hidden-secrets-gradle-plugin/releases).
Copy `HiddenSecretsPlugin-X.Y.Z.jar` to your Android project in `/app/libs/` folder.

Add these lines in your app level `build.gradle`:

```gradle
buildscript {
    // Folder app/libs/ will be crawled
    repositories {
        flatDir { dirs 'libs' }
    }
    // Add dependency to HiddenSecretsPlugin
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.klaxit.hiddensecrets.gradle:HiddenSecretsPlugin:X.Y.Z")
    }
}

...

// Apply HiddenSecretsPlugin to the project
apply plugin: 'com.klaxit.hiddensecrets'
```

Then sync your Android project.

# 2 - Hide secret key in your project

Obfuscate and hide your key in your project :
```shell
gradle hideSecret -Pkey=yourKeyToObfuscate [-PkeyName=YourSecretKeyName] [-Ppackage=com.your.package]
```
The parameter `keyName` is optional, by default the key name is randomly generated.
The parameter `package` is optional, by default the `applicationId` of your project will be used.

# 3 - Get your secret key in your app
Enable C++ files compilation by adding this lines in the app level `build.gradle` :
```gradle
android {

    ...

    // Enable NDK build
    externalNativeBuild {
        cmake {
            path "src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt"
        }
    }
}
```

üëè Now you can get your secret key from Java/Kotlin code by calling :
```kotlin
// Kotlin
val key = Secrets().getYourSecretKeyName(packageName)
```
```Java
// Java
final String key = new Secrets().getYourSecretKeyName(getPackageName());
```

# 4 - (Optional) Improve your key security
You can improve the security of your keys by using your own custom encoding / decoding algorithm. The keys will be persisted in C++, additionally encoded using your custom algorithm. The decoding algorithm will also be compiled. So an attacker will also have to reverse-engineer it from compiled C++ to find your keys.

As an example, we will use a [rot13 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) to encode / decode our key. Of course, don't use rot13 in your own project, it won't provide any additional security. Find your own "secret" encoding/decoding algorithm!

After a rot13 encoding your key `yourKeyToObfuscate` becomes `lbheXrlGbBoshfpngr`.
Add it in your app :
```shell
gradle hideSecret -Pkey=lbheXrlGbBoshfpngr -PkeyName=YourSecretKeyName
```

Then in `secrets.cpp` you need to add your own decoding code in `customDecode` method:
```cpp
void customDecode(char *str) {
    int c = 13;
    int l = strlen(str);
    const char *alpha[2] = { "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"};
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < l; i++)
    {
        if (!isalpha(str[i]))
            continue;
        if (isupper(str[i]))
            str[i] = alpha[1][((int)(tolower(str[i]) - 'a') + c) % 26];
        else
            str[i] = alpha[0][((int)(tolower(str[i]) - 'a') + c) % 26];
    }
}
```

This method is automatically called and will revert the rot13 applied on your key when you will call :
```kotlin
Secrets().getYourSecretKeyName(packageName)
```
# Going further
## Hide secrets for different package names
If your app is configured with different `applicationIdSuffix` depending on build types, your application's package name will change based on which build type your are running. You will need to specifiy which key to use for each `applicationIdSuffix`.

For example, considering your default app package is `com.your.package` and you have a debug app configured as `com.your.package.debug`.

1) Hide first the key "AAA" for your default package by calling :
```shell
gradle hideSecret -Pkey=AAA
```
2) Then hide the key "BBB" for your other app suffix by specifying the complete package name including the suffix :
```shell
gradle hideSecret -Pkey=BBB -Ppackage=com.your.package.debug
```
3) Create a function to get the key based on build type :
```kotlin
 fun getSecretKey(packageName: String): String {
        if (BuildConfig.BUILD_TYPE == YourConstants.BUILD_TYPE_DEBUG) {
            return getProductionKey(packageName) // Will return "AAA"
        }
        return getDebugKey(packageName) // Will return "BBB"
    }
```

## Other available commands

### Copy files
Copy required files to your project :
```shell
gradle copyCpp
gradle copyKotlin [-Ppackage=your.package.name]
```

### Obfuscate
Create an obfuscated key and display it :
```shell
gradle obfuscate -Pkey=yourKeyToObfuscate [-Ppackage=com.your.package]
```
This command can be useful if you modify your app's package name based on `buildTypes` configuration. With this command you can get the obfuscated key for a different package name and manually integrate it in another function in `secrets.cpp`.

## Development

Pull Requests are very welcome!

To get started, checkout the code and run `gradle build` to create the `.jar` file in `/build/libs/`.

Please make sure that you have tested your code carefully before opening a PR, and make sure as well that you have no style issues.
